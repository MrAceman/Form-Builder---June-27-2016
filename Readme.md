## Form Builder - Importing live data using ajax

This HTML, CSS, and JS was created on June 27th, 2016.  The goal was to take make an ajax call to retrieve JSON data and dynamically recreate a simple form using the visual mockup provided by Brit.

The primary purpose of this exercise was to work on using the ajax call and associated "then" to ensure that data would be returned prior to attempting to populate the form.  Additionally, further use of CSS styling, conditional loops, and some higher order functions were employed.
